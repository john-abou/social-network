## Description
This repository is the restful API for a social network that allows users to friend other users, share thoughts with other users and react to each others thoughts. Users can update their thoughts and delete/add reactions. The API is made with express.js and MongoDB/Mongoose. This was a great learning experience for practicing CRUD operations while using an ODM. I'm looking forward to building a fullstack application where I can put my new skills to use.
